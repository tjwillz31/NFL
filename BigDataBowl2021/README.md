This was my submission for the 2021 NFL Big Data Bowl. Contestants were provided player tracking data for every pass play in 2018 with the goal of analyzing defensive performance.

My analysis consisted of building models to predict the probability of being targeted at each frame of the play for each defender as well as the probability of allowing a completion for plays of which the defender was targeted.

Using the predicted probabilities compared against the actual outcome, players can be quantitatively assessed for their ability to position themselves in ways to prevent targets/completions and also their performance relative to an average player in the same situations.

Taking that one step further, I clustered defenders based on those metrics to establish archetypes of defenders in the NFL.
